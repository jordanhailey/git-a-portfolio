# Hey there, I'm Jordan! üëãüèΩ

I'm an aspiring Front End / Full Stack Developer who wants to work on impactful open source projects, and perhaps you're a maintainer of such a project who could use some help? Let's help eachother and work together.

## Technologies I like to work with
- JavaScript (including TypeScript)
- HTML
- CSS
- Frameworks like Svelte, 11ty, Express, React, Next, and Vue
- Node and Deno backends

## We can help each other

Send me issues in your OSS project(s) to dig into. I love learning, and contributing, and I especially enjoy good technical documentation - so I'll always over-explain my commits/PRs for any features I create/modify.

If this sounds like a good deal, ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Halfro_American). If you think you'd like to offer me a job (you're awesome) you can do your due dilligence on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanhailey/) and send me a message there, or through a DM on Twitter.

I'm looking forward to working with you and giving back to the OSS community!
