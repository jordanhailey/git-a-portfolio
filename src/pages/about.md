# About Me (Jordan Hailey)
## I've worked for an enterprise open source startup for 3+ years
I supported business operations at a venture backed startup as an Exectutive Assistant to the CEO, so I am very familiar with the fast pace of small and scrappy teams. I've closely observed Engineering teams, but ***I would ideally like to work on an Engineering team***.

## I was a full-time volunteer for 7+ years
I moved to New York as an unpaid volunteer to help manage housing and office projects that impacted 40,000+ other volunteers. I learned so many valuable qualities during that time, qualities that I believe make me more approachable and easy to work with. From my short time observing the tech community, I've noticed just how important positivity and inclusivity is. I believe the diversity in thinking and positive attitude I bring to my work will be a refreshing addition to any team I work with.

## I 💗 🇿🇦 music
I may be born and raised in little old Portland, Oregon, USA - but the rhythm of my heart seems to beat with South African Kwaito and Amapiano music (thanks to a lovely South African I married 😄). While some may prefer to study/work with lo-fi music, I get into the zone when I code with lively music.

## I am learning 🇷🇺
I have been learning Russian for the past two years, и мой русский довольно грубый, но я придерживаюсь его!
