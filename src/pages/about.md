# About Me

## I've worked for an enterprise open source startup
For over three years I supported business operations at a venture backed startup as an Exectutive Assistant to the CEO, so I am very familiar with the fast pace of small and scrappy teams. I've closely observed Engineering teams, but I would ideally like to work on an Engineering team.

## I was a full-time volunteer
For over seven years I participated in various types of volunteer work that required, on average, between 20-40 hours of my time per week; Volunteering is extremely gratifying, and the projects I took part in were no exception. I was able to contribute to helping 40,000+ other volunteers have suitable living and office spaces during a major construction project in New York. I learned so many valuable qualities during that time, qualities that I believe make me more approachable and easy to work with. From my short time observing the tech community, I've noticed just how important positivity and inclusivity is. I believe the diversity in thinking and positive attitude I bring to my work will be a refreshing addition to any team I work with.

## I 💗 🇿🇦 music
I may be born and raised in Portland, Oregon, USA - but the rhythm of my heart seems to beat with South African Kwaito and Amapiano music (thanks to a lovely South African I married 😄). While some may prefer to study/work with lo-fi music, I get into the zone when I code with lively music in the background.

## I am learning 🇷🇺
I have been learning Russian for the past two years, и мой русский довольно грубый, но я придерживаюсь его!
